Getting-and-Cleaning-Data_Project
=================================

The dataset is about human activity recognition recorded by Sumsung smartphones. The experiments have been carried 
out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities 
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) 
on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial 
angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for 
generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled 
in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, 
which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body 
acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a 
filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating 
variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

The dataset is divided into a train set (70%) and a test set (30%). The features about this dataset can be found in
"features_info.txt" and "features.txt". And "activity_labels.txt" Links the class labels with their activity name.

The R script "run_analysis.R" is written fllowing the instructions from the project of Coursera Course
"Getting and Cleaning Data", which are restated as follows:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
